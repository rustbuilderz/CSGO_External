# CS2 External ESP

A simple external ESP (Extra-Sensory Perception) overlay for Counter-Strike 2, built with ImGui and DirectX11. This tool reads game data from memory using offsets generated by the [CS2 Dumper](https://github.com/a2x/cs2-dumper/tree/main) and displays player positions, health bars, and team information in a click-through overlay.

## Features

* **World-to-screen projection** using the game’s view matrix
* **Entity list reader** to fetch all in-game players (excluding the local player)
* **Boxes** drawn around enemy players
* **Health bars** displayed alongside each box
* **Team labels** indicating each player’s team number
* **Threaded memory reading** at a 5ms interval for smooth updates
* **Configurable offsets** via `offsets.hpp`, generated with CS2 Dumper

## Prerequisites

* Windows 10 or newer
* Visual Studio 2019+ with C++ support

* Counter-Strike 2 installed and running

## Building

1. **Clone this repository**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/IMXNOOBX/cs2-external-esp.git
   cd cs2-external-esp
   ```
2. **Generate offsets** using [CS2 Dumper](https://github.com/a2x/cs2-dumper/tree/main) (instructions in that repo). Copy the generated `offsets.hpp` into this project’s main folder.
3. **Open the solution** (`CS2_External.sln`) in Visual Studio.
4. **Build** the `Debug` or `Release` configuration. (Release is a better choice)

## Usage

1. Run `CS2_External.exe` while CS2 is running. You’ll see a borderless, click-through overlay.
2. The console window will dump offset information and entity data on startup.
3. Enemy players will be highlighted with boxes, health bars, and team labels.
